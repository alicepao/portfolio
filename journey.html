        <h2>Beginning</h2>
        <p>Back in 2019, I was still a marketing student. I loved what I was studying and hdd decided to be an account manager for my career. 
            I got a job with a company called Stukent for an internship. I was doing professional selling and it was a fun experience. <br>
            <br>
            However, I knew that I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. I then decided to change my major. 
            One of my roommates who was a data science minor told me I should look into data science. So I did and found out that It was really fun.<br>
            <br>
            I was still afraid that I coulnd't understand but I still wanted to try it out. 
            I first took an intorductory python class and realized I really loved it. Then I took a SQL class and absolutely enjoyed my time.<br>
            <br>
            I decided to change my mmajor after doing some industry reserach and realized data science has very high demand. 
            I also did some preofessional interview with some alumni who graduated from the data science department.
